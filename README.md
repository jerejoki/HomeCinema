. The Living Room Image:

Take a photo of your living room from a high angle (standing on a chair).

Save it as living_room.jpg in the same folder as this HTML file.

Adjustment: If the seats (green squares) don't align with your sofa in the photo, look at the CSS section /* Sofa Positions */. Change the top, left, or right pixel numbers until they land exactly on the cushions.

2. The Movie Posters:

Download 3 movie posters (JPEGs or PNGs) and save them in the same folder.

In the Javascript section (const movies = ...), replace the https://via.placeholder... URLs with your filenames (e.g., 'dune.jpg').

3. The Trailers:

Go to YouTube, find the trailer.

Look at the URL: youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

Copy the ID code after v=. In this case: dQw4w9WgXcQ.

Paste that ID into the trailer: "..." section in the Javascript.
